# Educational-Codeforces-Round-17
These codes are the solutions in Python.
I don't write the codes in C++/G++ only because I am lazy. Maybe it is not so efficient.
These codes are tested on codeforces in the language type 'PyPy 3'. Some codes may not be able to run fast enough if you use 'Python 3'.
You can give me some useful suggestions. Thanks.
